# Progress
   - Day 1 (Feb 13, 2021):
      - Today was my first day working on Ben Awad's tutorial. I spent most of the time setting up the files. I learned about node scripts and a little bit of TypeScript (this is my first time coding in TypeScript). In addition, this tutorial uses Postgres and MikroORM to connect with it. I've never used either of the two before, so I'm excited to learn more about them.
